# Python-Web-Development
Folder of different Python language based Projects

These are the projects I've completed in CSIT 111, received grades for, and written solely from my thoughts (No AI).

Based off the grading, I went back and fixed the code to fit my professors criteria, making sure to aim for 100%. 

Allow these basic python projects to provide insight and knowledge for those curious about learning python.
